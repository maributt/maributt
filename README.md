### hi!!!! i'm mari(butt)
i write plugins for ff14 as a hobby!<br>
am self-taught so constantly finding new ways to ~~write better code~~ be less stupid ^_^<br><br>
my main two babies are [auto-umbrella+](https://github.com/maributt/auto-umbrellaplus) and [fpslimiter](https://github.com/maributt/fpslimiter)<br><br>

both are in a pretty stable state right now although fpslimiter is the first plugin I ever wrote before knowing anything about reverse engineering so it's a lil scuffed but works well (enough)!<br><br>
i also add little features to simpletweaks and yesalready sometimes but never pull request them but feel free to check them out too!!
